## Renew SSL Certificate (namecheap, nginx)

### step 1

buy NEWRENEWAL Ssl Certificate on namecheap

### step 2: generate csr

ref: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9446/0/apache-opensslmodsslnginx

enter command `openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout wish8.key -out wish8.csr`

like following ...

```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:TW
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Taiwan
Locality Name (eg, city) []:NewTaipei
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:wish8
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:*.wish8.com (this is very important)
Email Address []:admin@wish8.com

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:password
An optional company name []:wish8
```

and you will get wish8.key wish8.csr files
copy paste wish8.csr content to namecheap

### step 3

enter validation, contact info on namecheap

### step 4

get email from Comodo Security Services
enter validation code on Comodo website

### step 5

get email from Comodo Security Services include 2 files `STAR_wish8_com.ca-bundle`, `STAR_wish8_com.crt`
now you can see new wildcard on namecheap is active

### step 6

check your nginx server ssl config
ex:
```
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/ssl-bundle.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/wish8.key;
```
overwrite old (ssl-bundle.crt and wish8.key) files using just generated `STAR_wish8_com.crt` and `wish8.key` files
restart nginx command: `sudo service nginx restart`

Done~!! ^^
